My research interest includes **Multi-modal Large Language Model, Omni-modal Generative Models, and Audio-Visual Language Processing**. I am at CUHK, supervised by Prof. Helen Meng and Prof. Xixin Wu. I graduated from College of Computer Science, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Prof. Zhou Zhao. I also obtained Bachelor’s degree at Zhejiang University. I have published **first-author papers** at the top international AI conferences such as **NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML/ACL/IJCAI**. I developed a few well-known Speech/NLP algorithms including:

- **Multimodal LLMs**: [Seamless-Interaction (LLama4+Dyadic Motion Diffusion)](https://ai.meta.com/blog/seamless-interaction-natural-conversational-dynamics/), [AudioGPT](https://github.com/AIGC-Audio/AudioGPT), [UniAudio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00704), [Make-A-Voice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19269)
- **Omini-modal Audio Generative Models**: [Lumina-T2X (omini-modal)](https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-T2X), [Make-An-Audio](https://github.com/Text-to-Audio/Make-An-Audio), [Make-An-Audio-2](https://github.com/bytedance/Make-An-Audio-2), [FastDiff](https://github.com/Rongjiehuang/FastDiff), [GenerSpeech](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dmCyoqxEwHf)
- **Multimodal Translation**: [TranSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12523), and [AV-TranSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15403)


<!-- During my graduate study, I was lucky to collaborate with the CMU Speech Team led by [Prof. Shinji Watanabe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5xRA6QAAAAJ), and Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University.  -->

<!-- I was grateful to intern or collaborate at TikTok, Shanghai AI Lab, Tencent Seattle Lab, Alibaba Qwen, with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen), [Jinglin Liu](https://github.com/MoonInTheRiver), [Chunlei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCKZGb0AAAAJ) and [Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ). -->



<!-- In 2024, I lead or participate in the following research topics:
- Speech/NLP: multimodal generation and translation
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Audio/Visual
- Diffusion models: Image/Audio/3D -->
